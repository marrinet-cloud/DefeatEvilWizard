This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python by modeling a turn-based battle system between a player-controlled hero and an Evil Wizard. It integrates core Python features 
such as classes, inheritance, methods, randomization, and user input, while showcasing how objects can interact to simulate a game environment.The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clear understanding of how
Python can be used to organize data and behavior using classes and objects, and how to implement dynamic, interactive systems. feature of this project include Four Character Classes: Warrior, Mage, Archer, and Paladin, 
each with unique stats and abilities. Special Abilities: Each class has two unique abilities that can be used strategically during battle.
Healing Mechanic: Players can heal themselves using the heal() method or class-specific abilities, without exceeding maximum health.
Randomized Combat: All attacks deal random damage within a specified range, adding unpredictability to battles.
Turn-Based System: Players choose actions (attack, use abilities, heal, view stats) while the Evil Wizard reacts with attacks, Dark Blasts, and minion summoning.
Dynamic Enemy Logic: The Evil Wizard can regenerate health, summon minions, and taunt the player.
Victory/Defeat Messages: The game ends with randomized victory or defeat messages for an immersive experience.
Extra Mechanics: Miss chance for attacks and block/evade abilities make combat more strategic and dynamic.
to run the game make sure python3 is installed 
clone the repository. navigate to the project folder and run the script.
then follow the on-screen prompts and defeat the wizard. i will have a video demonstration included in my final assignment submission.
Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with OOP in Python and turn-based game logic. Key takeaways include:
Classes and Inheritance: Organizing character types and abilities efficiently.
Randomization: Implementing variable damage, miss chances, and critical actions to make the game dynamic.
User Interaction: Handling inputs and providing feedback in a structured, interactive loop.
Problem Solving: Designing a system where multiple objects interact, such as the player, wizard, and minion.
Strategic Thinking: Understanding how to balance health, attacks, and special abilities for a turn-based game.
Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of how Python objects and data interact, improved my critical thinking, and enhanced my ability to write clear, maintainable code.
This game illustrates that OOP can bring structure and clarity to complex systems, even in interactive applications. By building classes, methods, and interactions, I learned to model real-world scenarios in code and see the effects
of object relationships in real time. Adding features like miss chance and blocking taught me how small mechanics can significantly impact gameplay. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed building it!
